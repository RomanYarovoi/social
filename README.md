A different kind of social network

## Goals

Many social networks
become a popularity contest.
People want to gain a big audience
to broadcast whatever message
they want to share.

What if a social network
reflected your real life network
and acted as a rolodex
for your life?
What if you were limited
in the number of connections
you could have
on the network
to force you
to make choices that matter?

You don't need to be connected
to that guy
from high school
that you barely knew.
You probably don't really care
about the new baby
that he and his wife just had.

If a social network protected you
from spammy people
by limiting the number connections
you could have,
that would go a long way
to make your *real* social network more meaningful.

But we can go further!
Let's cap the number
of connection requests someone can make too!
If requests to connect are as limited
as the actual connections,
then those annoying recruiters will think twice
before trying to add you
to their network.

This is the vision
behind this social network.
I want to create a network full
of real connections
to people that you really care about.
